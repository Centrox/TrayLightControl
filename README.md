Tray Milight Control
====================

This is a Windows tray application to control RGBW LED lights made by MiLight or
its various rebrands like LimitlessLED. It allows you to turn lights on/off, dim
them and change their colors. Lights can be controlled by group or all at the
same time.

Instructions
------------

When the application is started for the first time it will show a configuration
window where you can set the IP address of the wifi bridge and the names of the
4 groups. Instead of finding and entering the IP manually, you can also have the
application automatically find the UDP broadcast address to reach it.

Press `Save` to save the settings and close the configuration window. You can
always return to that window using the `Configuration` menu item.

You can now right-click the lamp icon in the tray to control your lights.
